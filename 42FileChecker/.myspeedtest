Your program is compared with the original 'printf'.

How it works:
Both programs are executed one at a time with the same options so that time needed for execution is greater than 10 seconds.
During 10 seconds, the stdout of each program is saved in a temporary file and then the lines are counted.
The rate is calculated by comparing both line counts.

Warning: Your program must work perfectly (the same stdout from the original program) and you should perform your own test with a greater interval of time.

-----------------

# Your program:
./tmp/ft_printf_speedtest null
--> 566054 lines written on stdout

# Original program:
./tmp/printf_speedtest null
--> 3688025 lines written on stdout

Estimated speed rate:  15%
